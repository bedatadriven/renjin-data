# Renjin Big Query

Renjin Big Query is a Renijn package that exposes BigQuery tables as normal
R data frames.

Renjin Bigquery allows R to reference massive Big Query data tables without bringing
them into memory. Calculations on the data are sent to Big Query for calculation
rather than bringing the data to Renjin.

This is still a bit experimental, but still quite useful.
